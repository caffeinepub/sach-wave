  "summary": "The diff implements a new frontend actor hook (`usePatchedActor`) that creates anonymous/authenticated actors without calling the missing `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret`, and updates key consumers (App and React Query hooks) to use it. No clear missing requirements are visible from the provided diff summary, but some extra behaviors/UI-startup logic appear to have been added beyond the stated scope.",

    {
      "description": "Global invalidation + refetch of (almost) all React Query queries whenever the actor changes.",
      "reason": "REQ-1/REQ-2 require creating a patched actor hook and updating imports; they do not request broad query invalidation/refetch behavior.",

    {
      "description": "Additional startup-flow logic involving explicit timeouts/splash duration constants (potential broader startup UX changes).",
      "reason": "Non-goals include not redesigning the startup UI beyond what is necessary; the diff shows new startup timing constants and (per file summary) a more complex startup gate, which may be beyond the minimal fix requested.",
