REQ-1’s upgrade/no-data-loss acceptance criterion is not evidenced in the diff. REQ-2’s required non-admin visibility + banned-user-null behavior cannot be confirmed because the getUserProfile implementation is truncated.",

      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated right after a comment about allowing viewing non-banned profiles; the actual getUserProfile function body/authorization logic and banned handling are not visible in the provided diff summary, so implementation cannot be verified.",
