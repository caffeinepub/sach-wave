# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Promote the currently deployed draft version of the app to the live deployment.

**Planned changes:**
- Promote the latest draft build to live so the live app URL serves the same version as the current draft.
- Verify the live URL matches the most recent draft build behavior after promotion.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting the live app URL shows the latest draft build (same version and behavior), with no separate draft-only deployment remaining as the active live version.
